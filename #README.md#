# Copper
A minimal but usable Unity project for use with ink story files.

Currently at v0.1. You can grab it and give it a try; there are a lot of rough edges to be worked out.

More documentation to come. You can also load it up in Unity and run it, and the sample ink story file there will give you some info.
